# Websockets + LiveView on the Remarkable2

### This repository describes how notifications, streaming, and LiveView works via the Remarkale2 API. The bulk of the information is on the [wiki](https://github.com/poundifdef/rmsockets/wiki). It has extensive detail on how to subscribe to RM's websocket events and how to parse LiveView data.

`liveview.bin` Contains an exmaple binary payload coming from the LiveView websocket stream.

`liveview.json` Contains an exmaple of the binary payload parsed as human-readable JSON. (I've removed a lot of the data from this version just for readability.)
